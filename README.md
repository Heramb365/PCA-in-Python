# PCA-in-Python

Here, we use the PCA functions of the Python package Scikit Learn
The data was cleaned, centred and scaled.
A Scree plot was then made, where it was found that almost all of the variation was along the first PC. Hence, a 2-D graph of PC1 vs PC2 would be able to represent the data.

On plotting the PCA graph, the "wt" and "ko" samples were found to cluster together, respectively. On obtaining the loading scores of the genes, we find that the values are very similar, suggesting that a lot of genes played a role in separating the samples instead of being determined by only 1 or 2 genes.
